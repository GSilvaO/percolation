# Description
 The <strong><i>Percolation.java</i></strong> file implements the programming assignment of the first week of Princeton's Algorithim course.
 The main goal of this application is to simulate a property of materials know as Percolation. If we have, for exemple, a randomly distributed 
insulating and metallic material, what fraction of this material needs to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrial conductor?
 The specification of this assigment can be viewed at [this link](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php).

## How to run this project
 To run these programs you need to have Java installed and configured (version >= 5.0) as well as <strong><i>algs4.jar</i></strong> added to the classpath.

### Obs.

> 1 -The use of this code (or any modification of it) to solve the same assignment results in a direct infringement of [cousera's Honor Code](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code?language=en_US").

> 2 - The assessment score was 91/100. The main issues remaining to solve for this algorithm are some corner cases and the <i>backwash</i> problem.
