# Description
 The <strong><i>Percolation.java</i></strong> file implements the programming assignment of the first week of Princeton's Algorithim course. 
The specification of this assigment can be viewed here: <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php"><i>Implementation details</i></a>.
The other file's goal (<strong><i>PercolationStats.java</i></strong>) is to calculate some statistics based on the <strong><i>Percolation.java</i></strong> file.

## How to run this project
 To run these programs you need to have Java installed and configured (version >= 5.0) as well as add <strong><i>algs4.jar</i></strong> to the classpath.
